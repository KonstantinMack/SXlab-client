# SX Lab client

Front-end client for SX Lab, a dashboard using data from sx.bet.

The betting industry is being revolutionised by blockchain technology right now. New web3 betting exchanges like sx.bet make the betting process more secure, fair, and a lot more transparent. SX Lab utilises this transparency to help the average bettor become more successful. On SX Lab you can not just analyse your own bets to find your edge over the market but you can also investigate other wallets and follow them if you like their performance. Whenever your followed tipsters place a bet youâ€™ll be notified so you can join in on the action and share their success.
